This YAML code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "learn-github-actions." GitHub Actions is a CI/CD 
(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) service that allows you to automate workflows for your GitHub repositories. 

This "learn-github-actions" runs on every push to the repository. It checks out the code, 
sets up Node.js version 20, and installs the bats testing framework globally. It then verifies the installation by printing 
the version of bats. The workflow helps automate the setup and verification of the bats tool.
